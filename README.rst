msAI - Software Tools to Create AI Models for Mass Spectrometry Data

**Note:** msAI is in development. Currently, all releases are development previews. Features are incomplete and may change.


********
Overview
********

*msAI provides a library of python modules for...*

    * Extracting data from mass spectrometry data files

        * Supported MS file types: mzML, TBD…

    * Importing sample metadata

        * Unify MS data and sample metadata in a single view

    * Partitioning data for training, testing, and validation

    * Quality analysis of MS runs / samples

        * Metadata verification
        * Anomaly detection

    * Plotting / visualization

    * AI / machine learning frameworks

        * TensorFlow
        * TBD…

    * Creating AI models

        * Neural network architectures - neuron layers, connections, activation functions
        * Model training - loss and optimization functions, hyperparameter tuning
        * Evaluation of models - measure accuracy, prevent overfitting

    * Model lifecycle management

        * Deploy, update, backup, restore
